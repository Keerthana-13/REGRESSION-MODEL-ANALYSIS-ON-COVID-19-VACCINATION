  February 2022 containing details about the vaccination rate and new deaths per day.Applied different regression models 
  and analyzed them based on the parameters like   R2 square forfinding the best fit and Mean absolute error (MAE) for finding the minimum error, 
  along with Root mean squared error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
